This is just another Hello World project, part of the start of my journey to get back into web development. In college about a decade ago I got through basic JavaScript, and development has changed so much since then.

Thanks for joining me :smiley: I'm currently using:
* Microsoft Surface Book
* Windows 10 Pro
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 
* Visual Studio Code
  * Integrated terminal set to Bash
* GitHub Desktop (easiest way to initialize a repository & a readme, and the Project Manager extention of VSCode detects my workstation's git repos)
  * In GitHub I have the TODO app to pick up TODO issues from TODO comments in my commits
* Chrome
* Beaker Browser (deploying with ```dat://```)
